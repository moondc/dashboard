# This site is a work in progress
You've stumbled onto my website (how exciting!)  
I've built this site for two reasons.
1. To create a centralized hub to manage all the services that I'm building
2. To demonstrate my web development skills to bolster my resume.  

## Many of the modules may not yet have functionality
The fact that they exist shows that I will likely be adding content to them at some point in the near future.  

## The Menu is unorganized
The order of the pages and the topics that deal with are all over the place!  This is temporary, I'm currently working on adding functionality to each module and haven't spent much time on how I want to organize everything.

## Things may break at any time
Setting up proper cicd would be great, but that takes development effort and is not currently a priority.  If you notice a module not working when it used to then check back frequently because I'm actively working on it!
